# Transfer Learning Through Conditional Quantile Matching (TLCQM)

This repository contains Python3 implementation for the high-quality data augmentation (or synthetic data generation) for transfer learning tasks proposed in the following paper.
- Paper Reference: [Y. Zhang, S. Wilkins-Reeves, W. Lee, and A. Hofleitner. Tranfer Learning Through Conditional Quantile Matching.]() (2026+).

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.10 (earlier version might be applicable).
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (for neural network models and auto-differentiation), [engression](https://github.com/xwshen51/engression/tree/main/engression-python), and [cvxopt](https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt).
- Optional if only use the main functions: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for plotting).
